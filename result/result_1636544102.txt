Huge data sets require ad hoc  computational approaches to be managed and analyzed. Besides the  efficiency issue related to their dimensions, there is the important and  complex issue of mining useful information from data.  Several are the scientific challenges associated with big data, ranging  from data capture, storage, sharing, modeling, analysis, and  visualization. Among the complex aspects to be addressed there is the  integration across heterogeneous, interdependent complex data resources  for real-time analytics and decision making.  This special issue aims to publish selected research articles presenting  fuzzy logic based techniques in the emerging field of Big Data. More  specifically, it seeks for contributions standing at the cross-road of  theory and applications of fuzzy techniques in Big Data, including:  * Scalability and performance of fuzzy algorithms, data structures; * Novel fuzzy techniques to manage big data; * Applications of fuzzy techniques to large datasets gathered in  business intelligence, finance, healthcare, bioinformatics, smart sensor  networks, cyber security, etc; * Collaborative approaches where human and machine expertise are used in  a complementary manner.  Submission procedure  Please submit your article using the online manuscript submission  service at The submission website for this journal is located at:  http://ees.elsevier.com/fss/default.asp.

This proliferation of data and connections has made a huge impact on the tourism industry. For instance, consumers engage with social networking sites to research trips, make informed decisions about their travels, annotate multimedia contents, promote events and share their personal experiences of a particular hotel, restaurant or airline. Besides, the use of a wide range of devices (smartphones, tablets, smartTV, IoT, etc.) to produce, store, view and exchange multimedia contents, and the « always-on » users connection to the Web, continue to increase this phenomenon. Actually, through several devices, many famous applications offer to users to publish and to share, on the instant, multimedia contents (such as videos, photos, comments), to recommend and to connect those resources with their social audiences (e.g., friends, family, colleagues), to freely tag or annotate contents, and to evaluate with detailed statistics the popularity of a published data. For instance, Flickr and YouTube offer services for media publishing and sharing. In the tourism industry, several platforms allow users to disseminate information, such as TripAdvisor, Airbnb... Published contents can then be promoted and evaluated on the Facebook and Twitter platforms. All those platforms can be used anytime, anywhere and anyhow (i.e., with different devices, handled or not).  As a consequence, a huge amount of interconnected heterogeneous social media data can be generated, enriched and exploited by the Tourism domain for creating new research opportunities and challenges. As an example, information about some content creators, vendors and consumers with their related social contexts as well as the metadata associated to the media resources can be used by a recommendation engine in order to personalize the way that some contents will be promoted.  In this workshop, we will present original papers that tackle challenges or issues relating to exploit the social media and networks for Tourism, such as linked data, semantic relations and structure, content annotation, document adaptation, information personalization and data recommendation. The workshop is interested in both research contributions and industrial experiences (e.g., case studies, demonstrations, experiments).  Paper submission: July 20, 2016  Main Topics of Interest: -   Social data mining and analytics. -   Social multimedia tagging and multimedia content communities in the Tourism domain. -   Hybrid social and semantic approaches to profiling, recommendation engines or personalization systems. -   User modelling and dynamic profiling. -   Recommendation methods and techniques using social media and networks Information. -   Social multimedia applications for Tourism (live casting, audio-video sharing). -   Social web economics and business in the Tourism domain. -   Social network aggregation. -   Privacy/Security issues in social and personalized media applications.  The submitted paper should be at most 8 ACM single-space printed pages. Papers that fail to comply with length limit will be rejected. Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 peer reviewers. After the preliminary notification date, authors rebut by evidence and arguments all reviewer inquiries and their comments. Based on the rebuttal feedback, reviewers notify authors with the final decision. Selection criteria will include: relevance, significance, impact, originality, technical soundness, and quality of presentation. Preference will be given to submissions that take strong or challenging positions on important emergent topics related to Digital Ecosystems. At least one author should attend the conference to present the paper. The conference Proceedings will be published by ACM and indexed by the ACM Digital Library and DBLP. Paper submission is available online via EasyChair on the MEDES 2016 website.  Track Chairs: -    Sébastien Laborie, LIUPPA laboratory, University of Pau and Adour Countries, France. -    Richard Chbeir, LIUPPA laboratory, University of Pau and Adour Countries, France.  ",

The preceding editions of the FCA4AI Workshop (ECAI 2014 and 2012, IJCAI 2015 and 2013) showed that many researchers working in Artificial Intelligence are indeed interested by a powerful method for classification and mining such as Formal Concept Analysis (see CEUR Proceedings Vol-1430, Vol-1257, Vol-1058, and Vol-939).  This year, we have the chance to organize a new edition of the workshop in The Hague at the ECAI 2016 Conference.   Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a mathematically well-founded theory aimed at data analysis and classification. FCA allows one to build a concept lattice and a system of dependencies (implications) which can be used for many AI needs, e.g. knowledge processing involving learning, knowledge discovery, knowledge representation and reasoning, ontology engineering, and as well as information retrieval and text processing. Thus, there exist many ``natural links'' between FCA and AI.   Recent years have been witnessing increased scientific activity around FCA, in particular a strand of work emerged that is aimed at extending the possibilities of FCA w.r.t. knowledge processing, such as work on pattern structures and relational context analysis. These extensions are aimed at allowing FCA to deal with more complex than just binary data, both from the data analysis and knowledge discovery point of view and from the knowledge representation point of view, including, e.g., ontology engineering. All these works extend the capabilities of FCA and offer new possibilities for AI activities in the framework of FCA.   Accordingly, in this workshop, we will be interested in two main issues:   - How can FCA support AI activities such as knowledge processing (knowledge discovery, knowledge representation and reasoning),  learning (clustering, pattern and data mining), natural language  processing, information retrieval.  - How can FCA be extended in order to help AI researchers to solve new  and complex problems in their domain.   The workshop is dedicated to discuss such issues.   TOPICS OF INTEREST include but are not limited to:   - Concept lattices and related structures: description logics, pattern structures, relational structures.  - Knowledge discovery and data mining with FCA: association rules, itemsets and data dependencies, attribute implications, data pre-processing, redundancy and dimensionality reduction, classification and clustering.  - Knowledge engineering and ontology engineering: knowledge representation and reasoning.  - Scalable algorithms for concept lattices and artificial intelligence ``in the large'' (distributed aspects, big data).  - Applications of concept lattices: semantic web, information retrieval, visualization and navigation, pattern recognition.   The workshop will include time for audience discussion for having a better understanding of the issues, challenges, and ideas being presented.   IMPORTANT DATES:   Submission deadline: June 15, 2016  Notification to authors: July 10, 2016  Final version: July 25, 2016  Workshop: August 30    SUBMISSION DETAILS:   The workshop welcomes submissions in pdf format in Springer's LNCS style.  Submissions can be:  - technical papers not exceeding 8 pages,  - system descriptions or position papers on work in progress not  exceeding 4 pages   Submissions are via EasyChair at  https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fca4ai2016 (to be opened soon)   The workshop proceedings will be published as CEUR proceedings.  A selection of the best papers presented at the workshop will be considered for a special issue of a high-level journal.   WORKSHOP CHAIRS:   Sergei O.

The preceding editions of the FCA4AI Workshop (ECAI 2014 and 2012, IJCAI 2015 and 2013) showed that many researchers working in Artificial Intelligence are indeed interested by a powerful method for classification and mining such as Formal Concept Analysis (see CEUR Proceedings Vol-1430, Vol-1257, Vol-1058, and Vol-939).  This year, we have the chance to organize a new edition of the workshop in The Hague at the ECAI 2016 Conference.   Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a mathematically well-founded theory aimed at data analysis and classification. FCA allows one to build a concept lattice and a system of dependencies (implications) which can be used for many AI needs, e.g. knowledge processing involving learning, knowledge discovery, knowledge representation and reasoning, ontology engineering, and as well as information retrieval and text processing. Thus, there exist many ``natural links'' between FCA and AI.   Recent years have been witnessing increased scientific activity around FCA, in particular a strand of work emerged that is aimed at extending the possibilities of FCA w.r.t. knowledge processing, such as work on pattern structures and relational context analysis. These extensions are aimed at allowing FCA to deal with more complex than just binary data, both from the data analysis and knowledge discovery point of view and from the knowledge representation point of view, including, e.g., ontology engineering. All these works extend the capabilities of FCA and offer new possibilities for AI activities in the framework of FCA.   Accordingly, in this workshop, we will be interested in two main issues:   - How can FCA support AI activities such as knowledge processing (knowledge discovery, knowledge representation and reasoning),  learning (clustering, pattern and data mining), natural language  processing, information retrieval.  - How can FCA be extended in order to help AI researchers to solve new  and complex problems in their domain.   The workshop is dedicated to discuss such issues.   TOPICS OF INTEREST include but are not limited to:   - Concept lattices and related structures: description logics, pattern structures, relational structures.  - Knowledge discovery and data mining with FCA: association rules, itemsets and data dependencies, attribute implications, data pre-processing, redundancy and dimensionality reduction, classification and clustering.  - Knowledge engineering and ontology engineering: knowledge representation and reasoning.  - Scalable algorithms for concept lattices and artificial intelligence ``in the large'' (distributed aspects, big data).  - Applications of concept lattices: semantic web, information retrieval, visualization and navigation, pattern recognition.   The workshop will include time for audience discussion for having a better understanding of the issues, challenges, and ideas being presented.   IMPORTANT DATES:   Submission deadline: June 15, 2016  Notification to authors: July 10, 2016  Final version: July 25, 2016  Workshop: August 30    SUBMISSION DETAILS:   The workshop welcomes submissions in pdf format in Springer's LNCS style.

However, selecting individuals satisfying certain  complex constraints manually is a complex, error-prone, and time and  personnel-consuming effort. To this end, tools that can  (semi-)automatically answer questions based on heterogeneous data need  to be developed, as exampled by IBM Watson system. This Ph.D project is  to deal with instance extraction problem for applications that involve  rich background domain knowledge, such as searching electronic patient   records for eligible patients satisfying non-trivial combinations of  certain properties, e.g., eligibility criteria for clinical trials. We  name this task complex question answering. While simple questions can directly be expressed and answered using  keywords in natural language, complex questions that can refer to type  and relational information will increase the precision of retrieved  results, and thus reduce the effort for posterior manual verification of  the results. Formal queries are powerful in this context, in representing complex  questions and exploring background knowledge; however they are often  difficult to master, which makes such an advanced answering system  impractical if without a user adapted interface. To resolve the  problem,  this PhD project is to provide  a user with the possibility to  formulate her need with natural language questions that can be complex  pieces of texts. Apart from this easier interface, natural language will  enable us to formulate constraints that cannot be represented formally due to the expressiveness limits of  formal languages, but that can be directly verified using textual data.  ***Ph.D Work*** To achieve the complex question answering,  this PhD project is  to  develop a novel answering question paradigm that integrates  both formal  database-like query answering and texts based  question answering by  information extraction methods. This is because these are two important  approaches for complex question answering, but of each own advantages.  To benefit from both methods, a key contribution of this PhD work will  be the approaches for combining answers to a formal query   with   answers found based on information retrieval techniques, which has been   identified as a challenge  in question answering systems. It is to study the hybrid complex question answering systems by taking  into account the limits of both ontological reasoning and text  processing approaches alone. In particular, the following approaches need to be developed: - Text-for-ontology search: selecting relevant cases by text-based  retrieval for defining a subset of individuals to reduce the calculation  complexity of  formal queries. - Ontology driven search: querying the populated ontology for selecting  potential relevant individuals and related texts, and reranking these  individuals by verifying  remaining unstructured information on them. - Hybrid answer production: producing final answers to a question by  comparing and then combining the results from ontology based reasoning   method and text based processing method.  ***Required profile*** Master in Computer Science or related domain Knowledge in Semantic Web,  Information Extraction, and/or Artificial  Intelligence is required. Background in  Natural Language Processing,    Automatic Reasoning or Information Retrieval is desired. Programming: Java, python Language: good English level, French is not required Ability to work in team, motivation on multidiscipline studies  ***Documents required for application*** CV,  motivation letter, and recommendation letters Transcripts for Master and undergraduate courses  Please send your applications to brigitte.grau_at_limsi.fr and  yue.ma_at_lri.fr as soon as possible.  --  http://perso.limsi.fr/Individu/bg/ Groupe ILES - LIMSI Bât. 508, rue John von Neumann 91405 ORSAY Cedex tel. 01 69 85 80 03, fax 01 69 85 80 88  et  ENSIIE Ecole Nationale Supérieure d'Informatique pour l'Industrie et l'Entreprise 1 square de la résistance, 91025 EVRY Cedex tel. 01 69 36 73 44, fax 01 69 36 73 09  ",

However, selecting individuals satisfying certain complex constraints manually is a complex, error-prone, and time and personnel-consuming effort. To this end, tools that can (semi-)automatically answer questions based on heterogeneous data need to be developed, as exampled by IBM Watson system. This Ph.D project is to deal with instance extraction problem for applications that involve rich background domain knowledge, such as searching electronic patient  records for eligible patients satisfying non-trivial combinations of certain properties, e.g., eligibility criteria for clinical trials. We name this task complex question answering.While simple questions can directly be expressed and answered using keywords in natural language, complex questions that can refer to type and relational information will increase the precision of retrieved results, and thus reduce the effort for posterior manual verification of the results.Formal queries are powerful in this context, in representing complex questions and exploring background knowledge; however they are often difficult to master, which makes such an advanced answering system impractical if without a user adapted interface. To resolve the problem,  this PhD project is to provide  a user with the possibility to formulate her need with natural language questions that can be complex pieces of texts. Apart from this easier interface, natural language will enable us to formulate constraints thatcannot be represented formally due to the expressiveness limits of formal languages, but that can be directly verified using textual data."

To benefit from both methods, a key contribution of this PhD work will be the approaches for combining answers to a formal query   with  answers found based on information retrieval techniques, which has been  identified as a challenge  in question answering systems.It is to study the hybrid complex question answering systems by taking into account the limits of both ontological reasoning and text processing approaches alone.

It takes ontologies as input and determines as output an alignment, that is, a set of correspondences between the semantically related entities of those  ontologies. These correspondences can be used for various tasks, such as ontology merging, data translation, query answering or navigation on the web of  data. Thus, matching ontologies enables the knowledge and data expressed in the matched ontologies to interoperate.  The workshop has three goals: 1. To bring together leaders from academia, industry and user institutions to assess how academic advances are addressing real-world requirements. The workshop will strive to improve academic awareness of industrial and final user needs, and therefore, direct research towards those needs. Simultaneously, the workshop will serve to inform industry and user representatives about existing research efforts that may meet their requirements. The workshop will also investigate how the ontology matching technology is going to evolve.  2. To conduct an extensive and rigorous evaluation of ontology matching and instance matching (link discovery) approaches through the OAEI (Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative) 2016 campaign. Besides real-world specific matching tasks, involving e.g., large biomedical ontologies, OAEI-16 will introduce the process model matching track as well as a desease-phenotype track supported by the Pistoia Alliance Ontologies Mapping project (http://www.pistoiaalliance.org/ontologies-mapping-plans-participate-oaei-2016/)   within a specific matching scenario. Therefore, the ontology matching evaluation initiative itself will provide a solid ground for discussion of how well the current approaches are meeting business needs.  3. To examine new uses, similarities and differences from database schema matching, which has received decades of attention but is just beginning to transition to mainstream tools.  This year, in sync with the main conference, we encourage submissions specifically devoted to: (i) datasets, benchmarks and replication studies, services, software, methodologies, protocols and measures (not necessarily related to OAEI), and (ii) application of the matching technology in real-life scenarios and assessment of its usefulness to the final users.  TOPICS of interest include but are not limited to:      Business and use cases for matching;      Requirements to matching from specific application scenarios;      Application of matching techniques in real-world scenarios;      Formal foundations and frameworks for matching;      Matching and big data;      Matching and linked data;      Instance matching, data interlinking and relations between them;      Process model matching;      Large-scale and efficient matching techniques;      Matcher selection, combination and tuning;      User involvement (including both technical and organizational aspects);      Explanations in matching;      Social and collaborative matching;      Uncertainty in matching;      Reasoning with alignments;      Alignment coherence and debugging;      Alignment management;      Matching for traditional applications (e.g., information integration);      Matching for emerging applications (e.g., search, web-services).   SUBMISSIONS Contributions to the workshop can be made in terms of technical papers and posters/statements of interest addressing different issues of ontology  matching as well as participating in the OAEI 2016 campaign. Technical papers should be not longer than 12 pages using the LNCS Style: http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0 Posters/statements of interest should not exceed 2 pages and should be handled according to the guidelines for technical papers. All contributions should be prepared in PDF format and should be submitted through the workshop submission site at: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=om20160  Contributors to the OAEI 2016 campaign have to follow the campaign  conditions and schedule at http://oaei.ontologymatching.org/2016/.  Authors of the best biology-themed papers, system papers with  competitive results in the OAEI biology-themed tracks, biology-themed dataset descriptions will be invited to submit an extended version of their contributions to  be considered by the Journal of Biomedical Semantics (JBMS): http://jbiomedsem.biomedcentral.com/  DATES FOR TECHNICAL PAPERS AND POSTERS:      July 15, 2016: Deadline for the submission of papers.
